# Useful Minerals (1.21.x)
A mod, embedded well into vanilla Minecraft, which adds **Amethyst**, **Quartz**, **Copper** and **Emerald** tools.
Mojang has added quite a bit of materials in the world that we usually ignore and discard as useless. This mod changes that. There are now new tools and swords that are made out of:
- Amethyst
- Copper
- Quartz
- Emerald

This mod is extremely simple and easy to understand and get used to. Copper and Quartz need their respective shards to make all the tools. To make Copper and Quartz shards, simply put a `Copper Ingot` in a Stonecutter to make 1x `Copper Shard`. For Quartz shards, you need to put `Quartz` in a Stonecutter to make 1x `Quartz Shard`. You can also put `Emerald`s in a Stonecutter to make an `Emerald Shard`.

For Amethyst tools, use `Amethyst Shard`s, they'll work fine. Only Copper, Emerald and Quartz need shards.

For Copper tools however, you need breeze rods instead of sticks. The recipes for all the tools are straightforward like all the other tools.

There are some unrelated items called **Charms**. They give you +10 Luck, and can be crafted, in the crafting grid, with Gold Ingots on each corner,
Emeralds on the top, bottom, left and right and a Heart of the Sea. The recipe is unlocked when you acquire a Heart of the Sea.
